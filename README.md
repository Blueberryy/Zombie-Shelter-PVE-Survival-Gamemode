# Want To Provide Localization?
List of localization files

* gamemodes/zombieshelterv2/gamemode/shared/shared_languages.lua
* gamemodes/zombieshelterv2/gamemode/skill_info/skill_combat.lua
* gamemodes/zombieshelterv2/gamemode/skill_info/skill_engineer.lua
* gamemodes/zombieshelterv2/gamemode/skill_info/skill_survival.lua
* resource/localization/en/zshelter_server_settings.properties

Create a separate file for zshelter_server_settings.properties file. The file name is your language code. For example, for English it is named "en", for French "fr". Check other files in the same path for more context.
